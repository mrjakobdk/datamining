# datamining
Datamining is a package for data mining - what a surprise.
It aims to implement several clustering, subspace clustering, and projected clustering algorithms for both the CPU and GPU.

It can easily be install on linux using anaconda:
<pre>conda install -c mrjakobdk datamining</pre>

All methods take the input as numpy arrays and return the result as numpy arrays.

If you have any corrections or suggestions you can try to write me an email.
